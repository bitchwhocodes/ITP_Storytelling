How to Make This Work

- Fork the first example we did in class with the floating cube. 
- Create the MoveCube script and attach it to the Cube object
- Within the MoveCube script, add code to keep the camera attached to the center of the screen and create bounds for the cube so that it doesn't float offscreen
- Add a particle system to the cube
