Assignment 1


For this assignment, I wanted to share I Love Bees. ILB is an Alternate Reality Game. ARGs are a type of game that exist on the internet. They commonly share similarities with letterboxing, although the puzzles and riddles are recontextualized for their online venue. In terms of story, ARGs use networked narrative, a method of delivering story content in non-linear fashion and encouraging collaboration.

I love Bees was developed by 42 Entertainment as a marketing device for the release of Halo 2, the sequel to a very popular first-person shooter. 42 Entertainment had done a similar project, called The Beast, to promote the move A.I.

The game is interesting, because it is presented in such a way that players feel as though they are truly uncovering burried government or extra-terrestrial secrets. The game does require that players learn complicated mechanics, and it doesn't face players with a steep learning curve. The difficulty of the game is found in the collaboration that is required of strangers to complete the story. For this reason, it was a powerful and successful marketing tool.
