## Assignment Number 1

Walking home last week I stopped by a taco place I always pass but never eat at. I went inside and was struck by the colorful, highly detailed, animal wall cushions lining the dining hall. They ran the whole length of one side of the eatery. I was struck by the texture and went up for a closer look. They turned out to be carpets.
What was once on the floor and probably in different rooms, even different houses or buildings was now reconfigured into a giant wall cushion of fauna delights for taco eaters in Williamsburg. Strange. Very strange.
