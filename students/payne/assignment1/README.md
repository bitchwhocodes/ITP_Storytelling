## Assignment Number 1

Walking home last week I stopped into a taco place.  I always pass it but have never eaten there. I went inside and was struck by colorful, highly detailed animal wall cushions lining the space. The cushions were fixed to the wall, they ran the whole length of one side of the eatery. I was struck by the textures so went up for a closer look. They turned out to be carpets.

Floor decorations, that were once on the floor (and probably in different rooms, even different houses or buildings) was reconfigured into a giant wall cushion of fauna delights for taco eaters in Williamsburg to aide their digestion. Strange. Very strange.
