## Assignment 2

So I had an adventure in lots of things this last week. First thing I did was follow the tutorial and make Pong 2D...and this took an embarrassing amount of time. Mostly because my ball kept going through my side walls and racket. I made sure I had BocCollider2D, I trouble shot, I wne throught hte tutorial another 3 times. I finally reported a bug - because from what I saw on the forums, there were quite a few haveing this issue. Turns out, I did not have a bug, I just has "Is Trigger" check for my ball...which is wrong. At this point, I'd like to give a shout out to Julius formt he QA Unity team for pointing this out, and being ever so patient with me on this one. Once that was all good, I played wiht pong2D a little by importing a new asset for the background (space), and adding a trailblazer (purple diffusion). Then I went ot work on making a new game.

My New game also has a saga that I don't have time to go into right now - but I will later, promise. Just not, I finally settled on something I can deem a 'game,' though it's pretty rudimentary. I was trying to go for a Space Invaders thing, using raindrops and a bucket - the bucket would catch the rain, and go away, and once you get 10 drops, you win! (And there would even be a sound for winning...) I ran into some coding issues though, and I'm still working on those, but fo now, I have a very simplified version of this game. Basically, there's 10 raindrops, the raindrop disappears after it hits the bucket. Once you get rid of all the raindrops, you win - with sadly, no celebration noise...yet.

I will outline my steps in order, and explain some of the setbacks I had and things I'm looking into figuring out this weekend. But for now, I tried not to delete anything, just comment out what didn't work for me. As you can see, there was a lot that didn't work for me...

I'll document everyting, but for now, if you open up Toto in Unity, and load the 'Grasslands' Scene , you should be able to play the game. I made all the images in Adobe Illustrator, and spritesheet-ed them in. The music I edited in Adobe Audition...mostly, this song has been stuck in my head since I watched the Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard video that's been going around, so, now it will be stuck in your head too.

My main issues are figuring out how to code properly - I have very very very little coding experience, so I feel like I keep getting hung up on these little flubs. I have gotten better, but that still doesn't say much. I will say, the tiny triumphs I had were really exciting for me...I know they aren't big triumphs for anyone else, but I was really happy about them, and I'm looking forward to just getting better from here.

I'm going to keep working on this Assignment, but I wanted to get something in before class, so here it is...
