## Assignment Number 1

For our first week assignment in Sensory Driven Storytelling we needed to find an item that tells a story in a limited capacity – a narrative where you least expect it.

I’m not entirely sure how I got on this train, but I started thinking about graffiti – walking around the city, especially in SoHo, you turn the corner, see something painted on the wall and smile. A few weeks ago I came across a CareBears mural, but all the CareBears had the Wu-Tang Clan ‘W’ painted on their bellies. (And being ‘that guy’, I posted it on Instagram…). And I don’t really want to get into the discussion of art versus vandalism – but for this next statement, we’ll go with it’s art. What is wonderful about graffiti as an art form is that it evolves – someone does  a mural in the night, the next night another artist adds to it. That led me to Banksy. Banksy will do pieces that other artists can fill in the blanks on – not sure if that’s his intention really, but it happens. And if you get past the idea of vandalism, and look at it as evolution, it’s interesting to see what happens.

But I digress…so Banksy led to a few searches on the internet, which then led me to find this photo – which is not a Banksy. This is an artist named Skurktur, and his piece CYMK. He’s from Norway – and this piece in particular is in Trondheim. Which I’ve never been to. And I really wish I could’ve seen it in person in its full scale. But I came across it in photo form on the internet, and I kept going back to it – and now here we are.

So…I’m going to answer the 3 Questions based off of this:

Why is it compelling?
There’s a couple links I’ll post that explain the actual story this tells (it’s in response to political reform in Italy)…but for me, when I saw it, I loved how it showed the two opposite responses of these two beings within one image – the juxtaposition really spoke to me. And the fact that it’s on this huge wall that people have to encounter is wonderful. Especially when I’m sure there are people you walk right by it and are the man in black shielding himself, and people that walk by it and bask in it like the little kid in color.

How did you feel?
I loved it because it made me smile – it’s cute off the bat thanks to all the colors and the little kid playing in the rain. Then you take in the man in black under the umbrella, just trying to get form point A to point B without getting all mushy and colorful but he rain. And it sinks in, and I just think, “Huh…I’ve been both those people…”

What story does it tell?
It tells the story of people in their own world versus people in the outside world…and what’s great about this is that both of those people view the other as both of those things. What I mean by that is that both of them are in their own world (just getting through, and dancing and playing in the rain) – but both of those people can also be defined as living in the reality (having to deal with the struggles of getting through and having responsibilities, and enjoying what the nature world has provided that day). It’s pretty great. And it’s wonderful that you turn a corner, and encounter this on the wall.
