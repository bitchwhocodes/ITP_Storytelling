###OSC Receiver for Unity

[![tips](http://img.shields.io/badge/tips-appreciated-blue.svg)](https://www.gittip.com/heaversm/)

[I put together a video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/95584442) that shows how to drive animations in Unity via any device or program capable of sending Open Sound Control data. This tutorial covers touchOSC on the iPad and Ableton Live. The Unity plugin for receiving OSC data was found [in this thread](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/16882-MIDI-or-OSC-for-Unity-Indie-users/page2), and the simplified and annotated code and Unity file can be [downloaded here]( https://github.com/heaversm/unity-osc-receiver)
