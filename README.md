# Sensory Storytelling
Stacey Mulcahy 

ITP Room 20 

Wednesday 6:30pm to 9:00pm 

Narratives are often linear, with a start and an end, and sometimes even formulaic. How can we
create new stories, reactive or even dynamic ones using sensory input to help direct or even define the direction of the narrative? We will explore narrative driven games or environments in either 2d or 3d focusing on how sensory input can contribute to play and or performance.
Technologies and software to be covered will be Unity3d, communication protocols such as Web Sockets and OSC within the context of Unity3d to capture and share data, and the Kinect. Other hardware input will be addressed as needed through lab times.

## Grading
- Regular Assignments 25% (3 Assignments) 
- Participation and Attendance 20%
- Presentation 15%
- Final Project 25%

## Schedule

**January 27th**

Introduction to Unity and creation of simple game to gain familiarity with asset creation/import, introduction to c# scripting, familiarity with editor. 

Cameras, Lighting, Input, Scenes
Assignment 1[Thinking about Narrative in Unusual Contexts]: Submit via Github storytelling in a limited or unusual context ( ie. GIF animation, UI feedback, automated help system for home, airplane safety videos,video game ) that resonates with you. Document thoughts,ideas, directions etc. 

**February 3rd**

Colliders, Physics. Building a simple 2d Pong game

**February 10th**

Cameras, camera effects, particle systems, textures, and creative coding effects with Unity.

_Assignment 2 [ Application & Exploration ]_
- Submit an experiment that  uses traditional input ( mouse, key ) to affect the narrative of your scene using any of the techniques or items learned. Consider how this input might be mapped in the future. 

**February 17th**

Review of Assignments / Presentations. Exploring using the Kinect with Unity,mapping input in game to data, accessing joints. Oculus Rift if time. 

**February 24th**

OSC, Socket IO, Spacebrew - connecting Environments in Unity

*Assignment 3[Going Beyond Traditional Controllers]:* 

- Explore connected spaces by taking input from a non-standard source ( Kinect, Leap, VR, Arduino, Node.js, Web Browser, Ableton Midi etc ). You will be required to fully document this and creative documentation encouraged. See notes. 

**March  2nd**

Terrains, GUI and Sound.Exploring saving data for future possibilities.  Assisted lab and build time if available.  

**March 9th**

Presentation of Final Projects and critique.

***Final Assignment***

Tell a story in Unity using external inputs to affect the overall narrative itself. External inputs are not limited to the ones discussed in class and could include real time data for example.  Illustrate how the physical space can directly affect the digital narrative in a consistent and compelling way. This process will need to be documented. This includes:

- Sketch / Storyboard of the idea. Effective for communication, does not have to be high fidelity, can take a variety of formats, and good to review where you started. 
- Video Capture the project through video documentation. 
ReadMe documentation - Description of the project, steps involved, libraries included, experience in creating.
